<h3>Web Design</h3>
	
<p>This is a relatively new hobby for me.  Eighteen months ago I didn't know anything about computers.  Then I moved to L.A. to pursue music, and started taking temp office jobs to get a foothold.  Eventually one of these was for a large internet company (maybe only medium sized compared to Google, Amazon, or EBay).  Through my dedication this job grew into a full time position in the marketing department.  Slowly my role became more and more technical.  As I was increasingly exposed to HTML, I became increasingly interested in learning it.  I then began taking online tutorials for HTML and CSS.  Then I got a book called <i>Integrated HTML and CSS</i>.  Finally I began learning Photoshop, and the end result is this website.  For the record this site was completely hand coded by yours truly, without the extensive aid of any outside resources.</p>  

<p>I'm still very interested in increasing my knowledge of web design as well as learning some programming languages.  As I make new discoveries, I'll publish some information in this section.</p>
