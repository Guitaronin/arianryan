<h1>Life and Times of Skinny</h1>

<p>Although her specific date of birth is not known, Skinny was born sometime in 1987.  We assume her birthplace was Ormond Beach, FL, as that is where we met and came to know her.  Skinny had already lived quite a few years before we encountered her.  Nevertheless, the time and place in which the introduction commenced seemed fated from the start.</p>

<p>On an October evening in 2003, a very skinny white and gray cat ran at full speed from a neighboring home across the street to greet us (meowing the whole way).  It was our first night in a new house we were renting in Ormond Beach, FL, and this little cat was the first neighbor we had met.  She ran up like she knew us, and had been waiting forever for us to show up (in retrospect we both think that to be true).  We were delighted and yet a little unsure - should we feed this little, skinny cat?  To do so would probably start a trend, and we were not so positive she didn’t already have owners.  And yet, she was so tiny, so skinny, so cute, and so demandingly vocal we decided to go ahead and give her a little something.</p>

<p>Well sure enough, one thing led to another, and before we knew it "Skinny", as we had named her, was soon our newest and truly beloved edition to the family.  We found her to be a wonderful companion and friend, with an inquisitive and adventurous nature.  She lived with us in Ormond almost two years and then traveled with us and our dog Berta all the way to California by car.  We traveled through and stayed over in eight states (including FL and CA).  We smuggled Skinny in and out of hotel rooms by way of satchel ( we could not afford hotel fees for both pets.  Seeing as Skinny was small, she was the likely choice as far as smuggling).  As if she recognized it as her family duty, she never made a peep and was always extremely well behaved in the satchel, in the hotel room, and in the car.  We made it to California safely, and Skinny settled in with us in her new home.  We had many "new place" trials and tribulations, but we faced them all together, relying on each other - humans and animals alike.</p>

<p>Skinny, although technically a cat, often wore the pants in the family, strongly urging us to recognize the "feeding" and "attention" schedule, commandeering the bed as her own (she loved to get under the covers), disciplining Berta when necessary (sometimes lovingly doling out a few kisses, followed up with a quick paw smack), and generally communicating her opinion.</p>  

<p>She was loving and warm, and possessed a strong energy that guided us into needing her as much as we believed she needed us.  She lived happily with us almost two years in California.</p>
