			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I like to think of myself as a man of contrasts - someone with simple standards, but extreme ambition regarding personal growth.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I have been practicing martial arts, music, and vegetarianism for equal to or greater than half my life. I have a degree in music (Jazz Studies). I've worked extensively as a musician (teacher and performer), concert/event production supervisor, online marketing and product manager, and pizza delivery driver, and now full time software developer.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I reside in NYC, where everyday I get a little better at taking deep breathes in places where I don't trust the air.
			</p>
			<p>
				Previously I lived in Japan, where everyday I got a little better at asking for sushi without fish in it.
			</p>
