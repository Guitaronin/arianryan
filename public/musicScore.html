<h3>Film Scoring</h3>
	
<p>I have always had a love for film that rivals my love of music.  Creating music for film is just a direction that makes sense for me.  My experience is limited to one project - a 30 minute short.  However, I'm definitely interested in expanding this area of my portfolio.</p>

<p>The following are the key ingredients in my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thematic - I maintain a cohesive structure by incorporating melodic and rhythmic motifs throughout the score.  I also like to carry out the score with a consistent and suitable instrumentation.</li>
<li>Focus on the psychological and dramatic - I strongly feel that it is the duty of the composer to offer insight to the audience that would be difficult or impossible to discern from what is presented visually alone.  Therefore I would enhance the drama by attacking the subconscious of the audience.</li>
<li>Director first - ultimately the look and feel of a film is the director's responsibility.  I'm willing to take as many or as few liberties as required to satisfy the artistic vision of the project's director.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm eager to add more to my reel, even if it means little financial compensation.  That being said, scoring a film - even a short - takes a lot of work, especially if I have to put together an "all in one" (editing, syncing, writing, arranging, performing, recording, mixing).  Given that there is no shortage of film makers with little or no budget that want a professional sounding original score, my compensation expectations are flexible, but inversely proportionate to the personal satisfaction I would derive from the project.</p>

<p>If you are planning to make a low/no budget film and would like to know more about what I may have to offer, send me a message with your contact info.  Of course, if you are making a film with a large budget, let's do lunch!<br />
