<h3>Health</h3>
	
<p>As a young man (12 - 14 years old) I was overweight.  I was relentlessly ridiculed by my peers and my parents! Unfortunately, I had no education in this area to equip me to do anything about it.  My father finally started forcing me to regularly go to a gym.  This helped me get in shape, and then my subsequent interest in karate helped me stay that way - for a while.  At age 19 I began delivering pizzas for a living.  This rather sedentary practice, along with constant exposure to unwholesome foods, led me to once again store excess fat.  Fortunately, a good friend of mine introduced me to lifting weights and a little information about proper diet.</p>

<p>Typical to my character, I became obsessive about acquiring knowledge of healthy nutrition and exercise habits.  Over the last ten years my level of fitness has fluctuated significantly depending on my schedule and discipline level.  The thing that has remained consistent is my dedication to being knowledgeable of new scientific studies, and my willingness to experiment with different approaches to healthy eating and exercise routines.</p>

<p>I will publish articles in this area to provide interested parties greater insight into the fundamentals of nutrition and exercise.  For now let me just say it doesn't need to be complicated.  Most of everything you need to know was learned in grade school.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get regular exercise</li>
<li>There are four main food groups - be sure to have food from each, every day.</li>
</ol>
