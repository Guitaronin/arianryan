<h3>Foriegn Language</h3>
	
<p>I don't know what to do with this section yet.  It is one of my major life ambitions to become fluent in at least one foreign language.  I had three years of German in high school, and at one point I was borderline conversational.  Since then I've put some real effort into learning Japanese.  At the pinnacle of my effort I had a vocabulary of nearly 500 words, a strong grasp of the basic grammar, and had memorized all the hiragana and katakana, as well as about 20 kanji.  I was actually able to convey most simple thoughts.  Unfortunately, my vocabulary was still limited to the point that I could seldom understand a single word when hearing someone else speak.  I have not had time to devote to this study for about a year and a half, and now my knowledge is somewhat faded.</p>

<p>I've also spent a little time studying Spanish and Mandarin Chinese.  Now that I live in L.A. I think my foreign language time is probably best invested in Spanish, as there is a great deal of opportunity to practice with native speakers.</p>

<p>In any case, this doesn't help answer the question "what is the point of this page"? If you have any ideas about how I may expand it, shoot me a message.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>For starters we can have some fun with this cool translation tool.  If you really want to have fun with this thing, translate something from English
to another language, and then translate the result back into English - it's like automatic Mad Libs!</p>
