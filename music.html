<h3>Music</h3>

<p>I grew up in a musical household (both of my parents are musicians), and music is and always has been an extremely integral part of my life.  I'm not sure if I can even remember a time when I was not enthusiastic about music, but I do recall one major spark.  When I was ten my dad bought me a couple albums - <i>Led Zepplin I</i>; and Jimi Hendrix, <i>Are You Experienced</i>.  I dabbled briefly with the harmonica and the bass guitar in my childhood.  However, I was kind of a late starter when it came to getting serious about music.</p>

<p>My primary instrument is guitar, which I have been playing for nearly fifteen years.  I also play - in descending order of skill - bass guitar, recorder, drums, piano, harmonica, and banjo.  I'm not picky when it comes to musical styles.  I truly like almost every genre of music (I've yet to be introduced to any smooth jazz or death metal that I like, but I'm still open).</p>  

<p>As for credentials, I have a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies from Florida Atlantic University.  I've also been playing and teaching professionally for about ten years.</p>

<p>The following links will provide you with greater insight into every aspect of my musical skills, experience, and attitudes.</p>

<p>Enjoy,<br />
<br />
