<h4>SKINACHTERISTICS:</h4>


<ul>
<li>She liked to lay in the dirt</li>
<li>She lost her meow shortly after meeting her (a few weeks), and replaced it with a throaty , smokers cough version, but about once a year she would produce a normal meow</li>
<li>Liked to sleep under the blanket on the bed</li>
<li>Liked to sleep close up against us in the bed</li>
<li>At our home in Ormond she would chew our hair and step on our faces and lick us in the night</li>
<li>Eventually the phrase “licks equals kicks” was coined as a joking way of reminding Skinny that we did not always enjoy her kitty kisses</li>
<li>At our Ormond home we had a great deck - she really liked to sleep under it on hot summer days</li>
<li>She would regularly come home filthy and with a scratch or two from scrapping</li>
<li>You could call her name and she’d come running</li>
<li>She loved the sound of the recorder, singing, and live music in general.  Whenever Arian would play the recorder she would climb all the way up on him and push her nose against the instrument.</li>

<li>She’d often eat her food without chewing</li>
<li>She threw up more than any other cat</li>
<li>She’d use her paw to scrape out the last morsels of food in her dish</li>
<li>Often had a dirty nose from getting it in her food</li>
<li>Would claw the window screen to let us know that she wanted to come in at night</li>
<li>When we first moved to L.A. we spent a few months in a very tiny "pay by the week" place called the Ocean Park Hotel.  During this time she slept on a little shelf above head board of the bed</li>
<li>Also during our apartment hunting days in L.A. we spent some time camping in Topanga Canyon.  They don't allow pets out there, so we had to transport her through the 1+ mile hike to the campground in a backpack - she didn't complain (well, a little)</li>
<li>At The West End she had to be kept secret.  Thus, before maid service on Thursdays we had to use duct tape on every part of the room to pick up fur.  Then we had to keep poor Skinny in a carrier in the car for much of the day - providing ice water, electric fans, and air conditioning for 10 minutes every half hour!</li>
<li>The very, very tip of her tail was bent</li>
<li>She got herself run over by the car once, but didn’t complain</li>
<li>Luckily she wasn't seriously injured, but a small bone in her pelvis was broken, and she had nasty abrasion on her skin.  The vet used staples to seal that wound - she pulled out all her own staples</li>
<li>She snored a little bit</li>
<li>Had a loud purr</li>
<li>Gave Susan love bites whenever she’d pet her, but nobody else</li>
<li>She’d kiss Berta, and then follow up with a smack</li>
<li>Would always get a claw stuck in any fabric she walked on</li>
<li>Great vertical jump</li>
<li>Even cleared a six foot fence just 5 days before the end</li>
<li>She came running up to us yowling the first time we ever saw her, as if she already knew us</li>
<li>She was so emaciated that we immediately named her Skinny, although that name wasn’t always appropriate</li>
<li>Had one “snaggle tooth”</li>
<li>Arian would lay her on her back and rub her tummy, which she tolerated even though she really didn’t like it</li>
<li>She loved to take naps with us</li>
<li>She really liked to socialize with people when they came over</li>
<li>She liked to play with string/sticks</li>
<li>She liked to drink water from Berta’s bowl - even while Berta was drinking from it!</li>
<li>In fact she liked to butt in front of Berta when it came eating and drinking (which Berta respectfully tolerated)</li>
<li>Very demanding about meal time</li>
<li>She announced every action with “her meow” - jumping up onto furniture, jumping down from furniture, entering the room, when someone else entered the room, when you first touched her to pet her.  It was like she was emitting a kiai</li>
<li>She’d bite her own nails and leave the shells everywhere, but never clawed furniture (although she clawed the deck posts at our Ormond home)</li>
<li>Her favorite canned food had to have gravy</li>
<li>If you opened a cabinet without paying attention, she’d go in there, and often get shut in - only to squawk about it moments later</li>
<li>She much preferred outside to inside</li>
<li>She had a pink tummy</li>
<li>Didn’t like it if you touched her rear paws</li>
<li>Had a strange, tiny bump in her left ear</li>
<li>We tried to put a harness on her once, but she just fell over and acted as if she couldn’t move</li>
<li>Had really long whiskers</li>
<li>She’d flick her ears if you touched them</li>
<li>She liked to nuzzle her face really close to our faces</li>
<li>Her pads were pink and gray, but her paws were white</li>
<li>She’d walk across the keyboard when you played piano or worked on the computer</li>
<li>She’d ALWAYS lay ON something - book, piece of paper, shirt, clean laundry, whatever separated her from the bed/ground/etc.</li>
<li>Liked to walk on the edge of the tub while someone was in the shower</li>
<li>She liked to drink water off the floor of the tub after a shower</li>
<li>Didn’t mind riding in the car</li>
<li>She was really good about going potty in open, strange places, on the way to CA</li>
<li>If she wanted attention she’d always stand with her paws on the very, very edge of whatever she was on</li>
<li>Her paws were so tiny that it was painful to let her stand on you, even though she only weighed about 5 lbs. (“pin points of pain” was what we called it)</li>
<li>She had a favorite spot to sleep upon, which would change about every three weeks (back of the couch, window sill, on the bed, in the bathroom by the heater, etc.)</li>
<li>She almost always looked mad</li>
<li>She liked to share crackers, and potato chips</li>
<li>Very soft fur</li>
<li>She liked to drink water out of your glass</li>
<li>She liked being held, or to sit on your lap, or chest</li>
<li>She had such a big aura, that after she was gone our apt seemed eerily quiet - even though she hardly ever made a sound</li>
<li>If you didn’t feed her on time, she’d help herself by ripping open the bag</li>
