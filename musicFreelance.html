<h3>Freelance Musician</h3>
	
<p>I played my first gig at age 16.  Over the past 15 years I have performed as a regular member of 8 bands.  However, the bulk of my professional experience has come from working as a freelance guitarist and bassist.  I have filled in with bands when regular members were unavailable, been a part of or organized "one time" engagements with other freelancers, worked as a session guitarist on recording projects, and performed "reading" gigs.</p>

<p>My approach is sensitive, creative, and versatile.  I have performed nearly all popular styles of music, and have an extensive background in free improvisation.  Additionally, I always endeavor to be professional - show up on time, dressed appropriately, with pro gear (and backup gear), and no ego.</p>  

<p>I have the following skills to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent at accompanying singers and soloists</li>
<li>Strong lead playing in jazz, blues, and rock</li>
<li>Solid with funk and Latin rhythms</li>
<li>Very comfortable in the studio</li>
<li>Reading - cold reading is a bit of a weakness, but I can generally nail stuff down within 5 - 10 minutes of receiving the music</li>
<li>Willing to travel</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of this sounds like it may fulfill a need for you, send me a message with your contact info.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing from you,<br />
<br />
Arian<br />
