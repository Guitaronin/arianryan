<h3>Event Production</h3>

<p>I have worked for the Daytona Beach, FL production company Tom Cellie Productions since the spring of 1995.  For much of that time I have been in the capacity of Crew Supervisor.  Many of the events that we've produced are of a very large scale, spanning several blocks in dimension, and at times hosting tens of thousands of guests.  As every aspect of these operations is managed "in house", I've been required to wear many hats.  The tasks which I've supervised and performed include: providing hospitality to internationally recognized talent; outdoor stage, sound, and lighting production; electricity and water distribution; park security; park cleaning and maintenance; guest parking accommodations; beverage sales; high volume cash handling; and even the operation of heavy machinery.</p>

<p>Additionally, my experience with Tom Cellie Productions has afforded me the opportunity to work with countless internationally, nationally, regionally, and locally recognized musical talent.  This includes, but is not limited to: Bad Company, Blue Oyster Cult, George Thorogood, Blood Sweat & Tears, Billy Ray Cyrus, America, The Band, and many others.</p>

<p>Besides having hands on experience with a wide variety of trades, I'm also cool and capable in fast paced, high pressure situations, and have superb people skills whether working with operational superiors, "A list" talent, peers, or subordinate labor.</p>

<p>If you have a project and may be interested in procuring my skills and experience, let's have a conversation to determine whether this would be a mutually beneficial opportunity.  I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.<br />
