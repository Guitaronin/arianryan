<p>I accepted my first guitar student in 1995, and have continued to teach varying numbers of students since that time.  In 1999 I began teaching full time, maintaining a clientele of over 50 students.  I have taught approximately 300 students over the course of my career.  Through this experience I have developed a unique, effective, and organized methodology that is designed to assist students of all levels, with interest in any genre, realize their musical aspirations.</p> 

<p>The articles I've published in this category on this website are completely original, based on my own knowledge and experience.  I've chosen most of these topics either because they are related to questions that are frequently asked of me, or simply because I feel that the information is interesting and useful.</p>

<p>The articles on this site cannot replace the personal guidance of a quality instructor.  If you are interested in taking your musicianship to the next level, I highly recommend that you seek out a qualified teacher.  If you happen to live in West L.A. or close enough to make the commute, send me a message with some of your contact information and we'll see if we can arrange some lessons.  If you would just like to ask a question that is not covered here, ask away.  I have a love for sharing the art and craft of music that rivals the joy I derive from composing or performing, so I'll be happy to hear from you!<br />
