<h3>Recordings</h3>

<dl>
<dt><A href="music/wave.wma">Wave</A></dt>
	<dd>This recording of this great Antonio Carlos Jobim tune is from a Jazz 
      demo I made right after college in 2002</dd>	
<dt><A href="music/myfavoritethings.wma">My Favorite Things</A></dt>
	<dd>From the 2002 Christmas album <I>Let It Snow</I> that I recorded with 
      Susan Hecht, this solo guitar arrangement of this Richard Rogers classic 
      is the best I've made to date</dd>
<dt><A href="music/letitsnow.wma">Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow</A></dt>
	<dd>This is from the same album, and represents my ability to accompany 
      with simultaneous improvised walking bass lines and chords<dd>
<dt><A href="music/ohyeah_ohwow.wma">Oh Yeah, Oh Wow!</A></dt>
	<dd>Completely improvised vocals performed by yours truly. I recorded this 
      on the day (2002) I got my current home studio set up, in an attempt to 
      test it out. I've always had a special place in my heart for the results 
      despite a couple pitch and time issues.</dd>
<dt><A href="music/villianvigilante.wma">Villian Vigilante</A></dt>
	<dd>A bit of a departure from the previous selections, this is a cut from 
      an album I recorded with the short lived band Villain Vigilante in 2003. I 
      really thought this had potential, but for some reason it just didn't 
      quite get off the ground. Villain Vigilante is not actually the name of 
      this song, but I don't remember the real name, I didn't write it, I don't 
      have it written down, and I've lost touch with all the members.</dd>
<dt><A href="music/tylershouse.wma">Tyler's House</A></dt>
	<dd>All the remaining selections are taken from an original score that I 
      composed for a short film titled <I>Once Upon A Night In Venice</I>. The 
      film is a comedy about two detectives in Venice Beach, CA that are 
      searching for a missing girl that was kidnapped by vampires - of course! I 
      did an "all in one package", which means I wrote it, arranged it, edited 
      it, engineered the recording, and played all the instruments (except for 
      some guest vocals by Susan Hecht). This project called for an unusually 
      diverse selection of styles. This first one (my favorite) is homage to 
      classic Bollywood.</dd>
